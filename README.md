# WeatherPy
This project served as a example of python dataframes to process data and using an the google api with python to create a trip for a location while also retreiving the weather data from those locations.

Notes: Because the routes had to be while driving, locations that were overseas could not be included in the same itinerary.
However, some locations within the same country did not have viable paths.
